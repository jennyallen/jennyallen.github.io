To evaluate this claim, we introduce a framework combining lab experiments, crowdsourcing, and machine learning to estimate the causal effect of 13,206 vaccine-related URLs shared on Facebook on US vaccination intentions. Our model predicts this content reduced intentions by -2.3 percentage points (95% QI: -3.5, -1.0) per US Facebook user. Strikingly, we find the impact of misinformation was 50X less than that of content not flagged by fact-checkers that nonetheless expressed vaccine skepticism. Although misinformation was significantly more harmful when viewed, its exposure on Facebook was limited. In contrast, mainstream stories highlighting rare vaccine deaths both increased vaccine hesitancy and were among Facebook’s most-viewed stories. Our work suggests that curbing misinformation benefits public health, but highlights the need to scrutinize factually correct but potentially misleading content.","tags":[],"title":"Quantifying the Impact of Misinformation and Vaccine-Skeptical Content on Facebook","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jennifer Allen","Minali Aggarwal","Alexander Coppock","Dan Frankowski","Solomon Messing","Kelly Zhang","James Barnes","Andrew Beasley","Harry Hantman","Sylvan Zheng"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1689803392,"objectID":"0133fbd057515a281710aa04940d7017","permalink":"https://jennyallen.github.io/publication/aggarwal-20232/","publishdate":"2023-07-19T21:54:09.319617Z","relpermalink":"/publication/aggarwal-20232/","section":"publication","summary":"We present the results of a large, US$8.9million campaign-wide field experiment, conducted among 2 million moderate- and low-information persuadable voters in five battleground states during the 2020 US presidential election. Treatment group participants were exposed to an 8-month-long advertising programme delivered via social media, designed to persuade people to vote against Donald Trump and for Joe Biden. We found no evidence that the programme increased or decreased turnout on average. We found evidence of differential turnout effects by modelled level of Trump support: the campaign increased voting among Biden leaners by 0.4 percentage points (s.e.=0.2pp) and decreased voting among Trump leaners by 0.3 percentage points (s.e.=0.3pp) for a difference in conditional average treatment effects of 0.7 points (t(1,035,571)=−2.09; P=0.036; DIC=0.7points; 95% confidence interval=−0.014 to 0). An important but exploratory finding is that the strongest differential effects appear in early voting data, which may inform future work on early campaigning in a post-COVID electoral environment. Our results indicate that differential mobilization effects of even large digital advertising campaigns in presidential elections are likely to be modest.","tags":[],"title":"A 2 million-person, campaign-wide field experiment shows how digital advertising affects voter turnout","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Antonio A Arechar","Jennifer Allen","Adam J Berinsky","Rocky Cole","Ziv Epstein","Kiran Garimella","Andrew Gully","Jackson G Lu","Robert M Ross","Michael N Stagnaro"," others"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1689803392,"objectID":"68b9ad71cec8c4f28653df1dee4dc83d","permalink":"https://jennyallen.github.io/publication/arechar-2023-understanding/","publishdate":"2023-07-19T21:54:09.490975Z","relpermalink":"/publication/arechar-2023-understanding/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Understanding and combatting misinformation across 16 countries on six continents","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jennifer Allen","Markus Mobius","David M Rothschild","Duncan J Watts"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1689803392,"objectID":"788ee23b71c3e07aac5264d63897c1b6","permalink":"https://jennyallen.github.io/publication/allen-2022-addendum/","publishdate":"2023-07-19T21:54:09.018445Z","relpermalink":"/publication/allen-2022-addendum/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Addendum to: Research note: Examining potential bias in large-scale censored data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jennifer Allen","Cameron Martel","David G Rand"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1689803391,"objectID":"2507ae5195de6c659357a7817bd1a329","permalink":"https://jennyallen.github.io/publication/allen-2022-birds/","publishdate":"2023-07-19T21:54:08.859366Z","relpermalink":"/publication/allen-2022-birds/","section":"publication","summary":"There is a great deal of interest in the role that partisanship, and cross-party animosity in particular, plays in interactions on social media. Most prior research, however, must infer users’ judgments of others’ posts from engagement data. Here, we leverage data from Birdwatch, Twitter’s crowdsourced fact-checking pilot program, to directly measure judgments of whether other users’ tweets are misleading, and whether other users’ free-text evaluations of third-party tweets are helpful. For both sets of judgments, we find that contextual features – in particular, the partisanship of the users – are far more predictive of judgments than the content of the tweets and evaluations themselves. Specifically, users are more likely to write negative evaluations of tweets from counter-partisans; and are more likely to rate evaluations from counter-partisans as unhelpful. Our findings provide clear evidence that Birdwatch users preferentially challenge content from those with whom they disagree politically. While not necessarily indicating that Birdwatch is ineffective for identifying misleading content, these results demonstrate the important role that partisanship can play in content evaluation. Platform designers must consider the ramifications of partisanship when implementing crowdsourcing programs.","tags":[],"title":"Birds of a feather don’t fact-check each other: Partisanship and the evaluation of news in Twitter’s Birdwatch crowdsourced fact-checking program","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cameron Martel","Jennifer Allen","Gordon Pennycook","David Rand"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1689803392,"objectID":"8a57b3c93b6b7d4a7efc213b1edae087","permalink":"https://jennyallen.github.io/publication/martel-2022-crowds/","publishdate":"2023-07-19T21:54:09.155785Z","relpermalink":"/publication/martel-2022-crowds/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Crowds can effectively identify misinformation at scale","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tobias Konitzer","Jennifer Allen","Stephanie Eckman","Baird Howland","Markus Mobius","David Rothschild","Duncan J Watts"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1689803391,"objectID":"f6c12230ea5f69f4bfec46bf2a93ff0b","permalink":"https://jennyallen.github.io/publication/konitzer-2021-comparing/","publishdate":"2023-07-19T21:54:08.106213Z","relpermalink":"/publication/konitzer-2021-comparing/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Comparing estimates of news consumption from survey and passively collected behavioral data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jennifer Allen","Markus Mobius","David Rothschild","Duncan Watts"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1689803391,"objectID":"dd717d03fa6d45f8597ec094c125fb4c","permalink":"https://jennyallen.github.io/publication/allen-2021-research/","publishdate":"2023-07-19T21:54:08.691707Z","relpermalink":"/publication/allen-2021-research/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Research note: Examining potential bias in large-scale censored data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jennifer Allen","Antonio A Arechar","Gordon Pennycook","David G Rand"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1689803391,"objectID":"8fe54c1239eb32043355cd55ad77ccb9","permalink":"https://jennyallen.github.io/publication/allen-2021-scaling/","publishdate":"2023-07-19T21:54:08.393435Z","relpermalink":"/publication/allen-2021-scaling/","section":"publication","summary":"Professional fact-checking, a prominent approach to combating misinformation, does not scale easily. Furthermore, some distrust fact-checkers because of alleged liberal bias. We explore a solution to these problems: using politically balanced groups of laypeople to identify misinformation at scale. Examining 207 news articles flagged for fact-checking by Facebook algorithms, we compare accuracy ratings of three professional fact-checkers who researched each article to those of 1128 Americans from Amazon Mechanical Turk who rated each article’s headline and lede. The average ratings of small, politically balanced crowds of laypeople (i) correlate with the average fact-checker ratings as well as the fact-checkers’ ratings correlate with each other and (ii) predict whether the majority of fact-checkers rated a headline as “true” with high accuracy. Furthermore, cognitive reflection, political knowledge, and Democratic Party preference are positively related to agreement with fact-checkers, and identifying each headline’s publisher leads to a small increase in agreement with fact-checkers.","tags":[],"title":"Scaling up fact-checking using the wisdom of crowds","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jennifer Allen","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

Using a unique multimode dataset that comprises a nationally representative sample of mobile, desktop, and television consumption, we refute this conventional wisdom on three levels. First, news consumption of any sort is heavily outweighed by other forms of media consumption, comprising at most 14.2% of Americans’ daily media diets. Second, to the extent that Americans do consume news, it is overwhelmingly from television, which accounts for roughly five times as much as news consumption as online. Third, fake news comprises only 0.15% of Americans’ daily media diet. Our results suggest that the origins of public misinformedness and polarization are more likely to lie in the content of ordinary news or the avoidance of news altogether as they are in overt fakery.","tags":[],"title":"Evaluating the fake news problem at the scale of the information ecosystem","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jake M Hofman","Daniel G Goldstein","Siddhartha Sen","Forough Poursabzi-Sandegh"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1692759720,"objectID":"3d69ee1652f7eda0aec28ff07806eece","permalink":"https://jennyallen.github.io/publication/hofman-2020-expanding/","publishdate":"2023-08-23T03:02:00.124966Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hofman-2020-expanding/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Expanding the scope of reproducibility research through data analysis replications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Holtz","Michael Zhao","Seth G Benzell","Cathy Y Cao","Mohammad Amin Rahimian","Jeremy Yang","Jennifer Allen","Avinash Collis","Alex Moehring","Tara Sowrirajan"," others"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1689803391,"objectID":"25e8b6b0887385fbf2c286687aad11b3","permalink":"https://jennyallen.github.io/publication/holtz-2020-interdependence/","publishdate":"2023-07-19T21:54:08.251774Z","relpermalink":"/publication/holtz-2020-interdependence/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Interdependence and the cost of uncoordinated responses to COVID-19","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\nFeatures Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides Controls Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;) Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne Two Three A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\nclass: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\nOnly the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view Themes black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} Custom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; } Questions?

My vision for this project is a Rent the Runway but for designer wedding dresses (it's called "Something Borrowed"-- I'm super into the name). Wedding dresses are ridiculously expensive for exactly 1 day of wear; a designer dress costs about 4-10 thousand dollars and takes up to 5 months to order, alter, then wear. Something borrowed would allow brides (or debutantes) to rent fancy wedding dresses at about a tenth of the price. They could try on a few dresses first for a pretty low fee and then if they choose to rent one, then they could reserve it for a certain week or two before their wedding. I think that it'd be best if you could rent dresses on a per day basis, so maybe you'd rent for one day to try on then for 2 weeks for your actual wedding day.Obviously, my website's search function is super limited and I haven't set up any way to order the dresses yet, put in credit card information, or browse a lot of dresses at once as well as a bunch of other features. However, I think that this website is something that could have huge demand-- why would someone want to spend $5000 dollars on a dress when they could spend $500?  Also, I was thinking that "Something Borrowed" could buy pre-worn wedding dresses from brides to amass their collection-- like I said before, people don't have a whole lot of use for a wedding dress after buying it the first time.

And, since weddings in general are just super expensive, I feel like there's a lot of room for expansion into other rental things for weddings. Jewelry, decorations, bridesmaid's gowns, etc. -- Something Borrowed could be a one-stop shop for resourceful brides/grooms everywhere!

I personally chose to create this website after going shopping for debutante dresses at wedding boutiques in New York. The dresses are ridiculously expensive, and you literally wear them one time! Each deb season, 50 girls in Houston (which is wear I'm from) buy $5000 dresses and never wear them again-- that's $250,000 down the drain. It made me angry to just think about. It'd be awesome if those dresses could get recycled after being worn; people could save so much money. Also, since wedding dress boutiques can't actually carry that much merchandise, it would allow brides/debutantes to see a lot more available dresses. And unlike other garments in the fashion industry, wedding dress styles don't actually change that much from year to year, so you could recycle dresses for years. It would be so much more convenient for everyone involved.

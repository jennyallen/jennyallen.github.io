    	It's a dilemma that all brides face. You want the perfect day in the perfect dress to start the perfect forever, but perfect comes at a price. That's where Something Borrowed comes in. We have a huge selection of designer wedding dresses available for rental-- at about a tenth of retail prices. Before your big day, choose a few dresses to try on, and we'll send them to you. Pick the one you want and send them all back! Then, before your wedding day, we'll send you your chosen dress, and you're free to have the night of your life-- no stress involved. 

    	And newlyweds who no longer need their dream dresses-- Something Borrowed wants to buy pre-worn or vintage wedding dresses.
